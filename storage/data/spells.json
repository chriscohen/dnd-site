At the same moment, a weapon-shaped red blotch appears on your arm.</p><p>You can harmlessly absorb a weapon you are touching (even a poisoned one) into your arm, as long as it is not in another creature's possession. The weapon must be a light weapon for you at the time you cast the spell. The absorbed weapon cannot be felt under the skin and doesn't restrict your range of motion in any way. An absorbed weapon cannot be detected with even a careful search, although detect magic reveals the presence of a magical aura. The only evidence of its presence is a faint blotch on your skin shaped vaguely like the weapon.\n\nWhen you touch the spot (an action equivalent to drawing a weapon), or when the spell duration expires, the weapon appears in your hand and the spell ends. If you attack with the weapon in the same round that you retrieve it from its hiding place, you can attempt a Bluff check to feint in combat as a free action, and you gain a -4 on the Bluff check. An intelligent magic weapon gets a saving throw against this spell, but other weapons do not.",

                "description": "As you complete the spell's intricate gestures, you detect a slight buzz at the edge of your hearing. Your body feels warmer, and a feeling of security fills you.\n\nSpells and spell-like effects that target you are absorbed, their energy stored to power spells of your own. Absorption absorbs only ranged spells that have you as a target. Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level. For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take. For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chance to be affected.\n\nfor example, you have three spell levels of absorption remaining and are struck by dominate person cast as a 5th level spell. Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. If affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you're struck by disintegrate cast as a 6th-level spell with four levels of absorption remaining, two level of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (1/3) of the damage you would normally take from the spell.\n\nYou can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don't disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used). The levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell.",

You cannot pronounce an anathema against someone who is already dead.\n\nSome deities do not allow an anathema to be pronounced against the innocent or against their chosen, while others grant their high-level clerics free use of this most terrible of divine curses.\n\nAn individual under anathema can no longer cast divine spells or call upon the power of their god to turn or command undead, heal, harm, smite, shape change, or use any other divine power associated with their character class.\n\nAn ordinary worshiper placed under anathema is not allowed to take advantage of any of the faith's services, such as healing, naming, marrying, or burial of the dead. Anyone who dies while under anathema is barred from entry into their deity's plane just as though they had never declared allegiance to a god. Their soul is condemned to eternally writhe in the Wall of the Faithless.\n\nOn a more personal level, the anathema spell marks the subject as accursed with regard to others of the faith. Others are not allowed to speak to them, look at them, or even acknowledge their existence. The common members of the faith are only aware that the subject is under anathema if so informed by the church hierarchy, however, clerics, paladins, druids and rangers of the faith can automatically detect an anathema effect simply by looking at the subject.\n\nThe effect is permanent until lifted, either by the original spellcaster, or by a cleric of the same faith, of a higher level than the caster, who casts an atonement spell upon the subject. The subject of an anathema can also remove its effect by changing their divine allegiance (see Changing Deities, page 233 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting).",

The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the spell ineffective.\n\nLikewise, the caster must be able to identify the target. The caster cannot direct a magic missile to \"Strike the commander of the legion,\" unless they can single out the commander from the rest of the soldiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no effect.\n\nAgainst creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4 + 1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile—two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple missile capability, they can have them strike a single target creature or several creatures, as desired.",
