The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the spell ineffective.\n\nLikewise, the caster must be able to identify the target. The caster cannot direct a magic missile to \"Strike the commander of the legion,\" unless they can single out the commander from the rest of the soldiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no effect.\n\nAgainst creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4 + 1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile—two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple missile capability, they can have them strike a single target creature or several creatures, as desired.",
